# Visual Changes
## Color
* What is the "color" of the scene?
* Changes dynamically based on story? Depends on how the js works
** would be cool it changes bases on day v. night at least
** animations for certain actions (lag); maybe this can just be pure css hopefully?
** maybe literally remove all other text besides the result of the current action? <-- would help reading
** Left and right padding (even on mobile!)

# Story changes
## If there's time
* Add more rooms
* Add the story I wrote down before
* Make the maze a game, instead of an experience?
    - That would involve making a right and a wrong choice
    - What if it's an action you have to do?
    - ie. your thing goes critical, you try to figure out how to notify the doctors
    - if you can't, you "decided" and they pass
    - if you can, they're saved (but the story hints they die some other way anyway, lol)
* Maybe, but it's still an experience--your success or failure continues the Story
* Have the text be bounded such that text doesn't reach too long to the sides
* Change it so the prompt disappears after you're done
# Logic changes
## Verbs
* change the result to acknowledge that you didn't read
* "how wrong you were" to dependent (to also have "you were right, but...")
* Have the "it's time" text to be warned 2 hours ahead
* go to living room
* Prefer that the prompt changes width (somehow)
* Continue next line,
* Die as kill myself
* CHANGE INTROSPECTION CoUNTER, IT'S BROKEN
## Other
* Balance time and game story as needed
* make it mobile friendly, then link to it (link: https://goo.gl/jDmbJo)
