# Story changes
## If there's time
* Add more rooms
* Add the story I wrote down before
* Make the maze a game, instead of an experience?
    - That would involve making a right and a wrong choice
    - What if it's an action you have to do?
    - ie. your thing goes critical, you try to figure out how to notify the doctors
    - if you can't, you "decided" and they pass
    - if you can, they're saved (but the story hints they die some other way anyway, lol)
* Maybe, but it's still an experience--your success or failure continues the Story
