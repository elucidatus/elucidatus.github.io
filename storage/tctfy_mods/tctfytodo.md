# Visual Changes
## Color
* What is the "color" of the scene?
* Changes dynamically based on story? Depends on how the js works
** would be cool it changes bases on day v. night at least
** animations for certain actions (lag)

# Story changes
## If there's time
* Add more rooms
* Add the story I wrote down before
* Make the maze a game, instead of an experience?
    - That would involve making a right and a wrong choice
    - What if it's an action you have to do?
    - ie. your thing goes critical, you try to figure out how to notify the doctors
    - if you can't, you "decided" and they pass
    - if you can, they're saved (but the story hints they die some other way anyway, lol)

# Logic changes
## Verbs
* smell chair       // done
* jump into bed     // done
* jump in bed       // done
* sink in bed       // done
* sink into bed     // done
## Other
