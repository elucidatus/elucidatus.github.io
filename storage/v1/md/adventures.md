# 12/30: Family

The whole family sat down for a few games of Exploding Kittens (include ing the first 2 expansion packs, Imploding Kittens and Streaking Kitten.) It was fun as Patrick (my 9-month old nephew) climbed around and try to eat the cards as we defused Exploding Kittens with kitten belly rubs.
It was one of those once-a-year moments; my parents, who live in Texas in a 4-bedroom house by themselves, were ecstatic. My sisters live in the Northeast; I live in California. We enjoyed each other's company next to the Christmas tree.
