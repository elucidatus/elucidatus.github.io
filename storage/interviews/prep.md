# Prepping for The Technical Interview
## Long Term
1. Study data structures/algorithms book (see bookmark); Steven Skiena's The Algorithm Design Manual
2. Interview with friends

## Cram mode

### Big-O complexity analysis

### Sort (quicksort, mergesort)

### Hashtables and Maps (and their O in ur language)

### Trees (binary, n-ary, trie); Min/Max Heaps
* Traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder), manipulation, construction
* At least 1 balanced (red/black, AVL, or splay)

### Graphs
* representation in memory
* BFS/DFS, Dijkstra, A*

### NP-complete
* travelling salesman, knapsack, etc.

### Math
* Combinations/Permutations/Counting

### OSes
* Locks, mutexes, semaphores, monitors
* Processes, threads, concurrency, context switching
