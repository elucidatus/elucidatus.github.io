* superclass, base class
* subclass, derived class
* inheritance
* encapsulation
* multiple inheritance (& give example)
* delegation/forwarding
* composition, aggregation
* abstract class
* interface/protocol (& diff from abstract)
* method overriding
* method overloading (and diff from override)
* polymorphism (w/o examples)

* method signatures (what's included)
* method visibility (public, private, other)

### Regex and Scripting
* \...-...-....\g ... or whatever for phone #'s 

### Big-O complexity analysis
* constant, log, polynomial (^n), exponential (n^), factorial (n!)

### Sort (quicksort, mergesort)

### Hashtables and Maps (and their O in ur language)

### Trees (binary, n-ary, trie); Min/Max Heaps
* Traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder), manipulation, construction
* At least 1 balanced (red/black, AVL, or splay)

### Graphs
* representation in memory
* BFS/DFS, Dijkstra, A*

### NP-complete
* travelling salesman, knapsack, etc.
