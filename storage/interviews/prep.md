# Prepping for The Technical Interview
## Long Term
1. Study data structures/algorithms book (see bookmark); Steven Skiena's The Algorithm Design Manual
2. Interview with friends

## Cram mode

### Coding
* Print from I/O
* Text formatting (printf or str.format) 
#### OOP
* class, object (and diff)
* instantiation
* method (vs C function)
* virtual method, pure virtual method
* class/static method
* static/class initializer
* constructor
* destructor/finalizer
* superclass, base class
* subclass, derived class
* inheritance
* encapsulation
* multiple inheritance (& give example)
* delegation/forwarding
* composition, aggregation
* abstract class
* interface/protocol (& diff from abstract)
* method overriding
* method overloading (and diff from override)
* polymorphism (w/o examples)
* is-a vs. has-a relationship (w/ examples)
* method signatures (what's included)
* method visibility (public, private, other)

### Big-O complexity analysis

### Sort (quicksort, mergesort)

### Hashtables and Maps (and their O in ur language)

### Trees (binary, n-ary, trie); Min/Max Heaps
* Traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder), manipulation, construction
* At least 1 balanced (red/black, AVL, or splay)

### Graphs
* representation in memory
* BFS/DFS, Dijkstra, A*

### NP-complete
* travelling salesman, knapsack, etc.

### Math
* Combinations/Permutations/Counting

### OSes
* Locks, mutexes, semaphores, monitors
* Processes, threads, concurrency, context switching
