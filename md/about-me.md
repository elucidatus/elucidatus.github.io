# Hung The Nguyen

I am a 3rd year Computer Science student at Stanford, on the Systems track.
I've always been interested in computers and technology, ever since I started playing and tinkering with the Nintendo DS and the iPhone. I believe that computer science can help people on a large scale by solving difficult problems and creating impactful products (and it's both fun and fulfilling to do both!)
