            <p>
                I am a 4th year Computer Science student at Stanford. I've been studying software systems, 
                but I also have a big passion for educational/serious games. </p>
            <p>
                I believe that computer science can help people on a large scale by solving difficult 
                problems and creating impactful products. </p>
