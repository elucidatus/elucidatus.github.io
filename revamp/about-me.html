        <p>
            I am a 4th year Computer Science student at Stanford. I've been studying software systems, 
            but I also have a big passion for educational/serious games. </p>
        <p>
            I believe that computer science can help people on a large scale by solving difficult 
            problems and creating impactful products. </p>
        <p>
            Some of my current inspirations are <a href="https://ncase.me" target="_blank">Nicky Case</a> and 
            <a href="https://w.itch.io/" target="_blank">Anna Anthropy</a>.
