Welcome! My name is Hung, and I'm glad you found this website. Hopefully, you're where you expect to be! Through this site, you can learn a little bit more about me and what I do.

This page is definitely under construction, so there isn't as much as I'd like here yet. I'll try to update this in a couple months, but for now there won't be any updates :( 

My todo list of improvements for this webpage (which I made with vanilla HTML5, CSS, and JS), in no particular order:
* adapt for mobile 
* a page to log my technical adventures (I have many, including hackintosh'ing, editing vim/tmux/konsole configs, etc.)
* a page to log my other adventures (learning, drawing, traveling, etc.)
* a page just for games, possibly even in-browser (once I've made enough games to have a portfolio)
* make this more colorful & happier with pictures, interactivity, etc.
* a better design for this page
* feedback form
* comment section?
